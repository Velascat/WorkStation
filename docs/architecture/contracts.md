# Canonical Cross-Repo Contracts

This document defines the platform's canonical data contracts — the typed,
backend-agnostic models that structure communication between ControlPlane,
SwitchBoard, and execution backends (kodo, Archon, etc.).

---

## What contracts are

Contracts are Pydantic v2 models that travel across component boundaries.
They are:

- **Backend-agnostic** — they do not reference kodo, Archon, or any specific runner
- **Serialisable** — all fields round-trip cleanly through JSON
- **Validated** — Pydantic enforces field constraints at construction time
- **Frozen** — all contract models are immutable after construction

Contracts are not internal domain models. ControlPlane has internal models
(`BoardTask`, `RepoTarget`) that are Plane-workflow-specific and stay inside
ControlPlane. Contracts are the surface where components meet.

---

## Canonical ownership

> Contracts live in ControlPlane (`src/control_plane/contracts/`).

ControlPlane is the upstream origin of all work in the system. It proposes
tasks, it consumes results. Locating contracts here avoids circular dependencies:
SwitchBoard and kodo consume contracts but do not produce them upstream.

When contracts need to be consumed in SwitchBoard or a backend adapter, they are
imported from the `control-plane` package or vendored from the same source if a
consumer cannot depend on that package directly. The source of truth remains
`src/control_plane/contracts/`.

## Contract models

### TaskProposal

Emitted by ControlPlane when it decides a task is worth attempting.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `proposal_id` | str (uuid) | Unique proposal identifier |
| `task_id` | str | Upstream task ID (Plane board task) |
| `project_id` | str | Project the task belongs to |
| `task_type` | TaskType | Category: lint_fix, bug_fix, documentation, … |
| `execution_mode` | ExecutionMode | Strategy: goal, fix_pr, test_campaign, … |
| `goal_text` | str | Natural-language goal description |
| `constraints_text` | str? | Natural-language constraints |
| `target` | TaskTarget | Repo, branch, allowed paths |
| `priority` | Priority | low / normal / high / critical |
| `risk_level` | RiskLevel | ControlPlane's risk estimate |
| `constraints` | ExecutionConstraints | Timeout, max files, validation policy |
| `validation_profile` | ValidationProfile | Commands to run, fail-fast flag |
| `branch_policy` | BranchPolicy | Branch prefix, push-on-success, open-PR |
| `proposed_at` | datetime | UTC timestamp |
| `proposer` | str? | Component that created the proposal |
| `labels` | list[str] | Free-form tags |

**Invariants:** Frozen. `proposal_id` is auto-generated UUID. `priority` defaults
to `normal`, `risk_level` to `low`.

---

### LaneDecision

Emitted by SwitchBoard in response to a TaskProposal.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `decision_id` | str (uuid) | Unique decision identifier |
| `proposal_id` | str | Reference to the originating proposal |
| `selected_lane` | LaneName | claude_cli / codex_cli / aider_local |
| `selected_backend` | BackendName | kodo / archon / openclaw |
| `confidence` | float [0–1] | Routing confidence |
| `policy_rule_matched` | str? | Name of the policy rule that fired |
| `rationale` | str? | Human-readable explanation |
| `alternatives_considered` | list[LaneName] | Other lanes evaluated |
| `decided_at` | datetime | UTC timestamp |
| `switchboard_version` | str? | SwitchBoard version for audit |

**Invariants:** Frozen. References proposal by ID only — does not embed the proposal.

---

### ExecutionRequest

Produced by ControlPlane's execution boundary after receiving a TaskProposal +
LaneDecision. Contains everything the backend adapter needs, including
execution-layer details (workspace path, branch name) that are not present in
the proposal.

| `base_branch` | str | Source branch for the task branch |
| `task_branch` | str | Branch created for this run |
| `workspace_path` | Path | Absolute path to checked-out workspace |
| `goal_file_path` | Path? | Path to goal file in workspace |
| `allowed_paths` | list[str] | Paths the backend may modify |
| `max_changed_files` | int? | Abort threshold |

| `require_clean_validation` | bool | Fail if validation commands fail |
| `validation_commands` | list[str] | Commands to run after execution |
| `requested_at` | datetime | UTC timestamp |

---

### ExecutionArtifact

A discrete artifact produced during execution — diff, patch, report, log excerpt.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|

| `artifact_type` | ArtifactType | diff, patch, validation_report, log_excerpt, … |
| `label` | str | Short human-readable label |
| `content` | str? | Inline content (small artifacts) |
| `uri` | str? | External URI (large artifacts) |
| `size_bytes` | int? | Size |
| `produced_at` | datetime | UTC timestamp |

---

### RunTelemetry

Timing and resource data for one execution run. Separated from ExecutionResult
to keep the result clean for routing/retry logic.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `run_id` | str | Matches ExecutionResult.run_id |
| `started_at` / `finished_at` | datetime | Execution wall-clock bounds |
| `duration_ms` | int | Wall-clock duration |
| `llm_calls` | int | Total LLM API calls made |
| `llm_input_tokens` | int | Total input tokens consumed |
| `llm_output_tokens` | int | Total output tokens produced |
| `tool_calls` | int | Total tool invocations |
| `lane_name` | str? | Lane that executed the run |

## Design principles

**Frozen models.** All contract types use `model_config = {"frozen": True}`.
Contracts represent facts that happened or decisions that were made. They should
not be mutated after construction.

**str-based enums.** All enums extend `str`. This means enum values pass `json.dumps`
without a custom serialiser and display as plain strings in logs.

**No internal types in contracts.** Contracts do not reference ControlPlane's
internal domain types (`BoardTask`, `RepoTarget`). Those live in
`src/control_plane/domain/models.py` and are ControlPlane-internal.

**Auto-generated IDs.** `proposal_id`, `decision_id`, `run_id`, and `artifact_id`
are UUID strings generated at construction time. Callers can override them to
provide externally-tracked IDs.

**Optional telemetry.** `RunTelemetry` is a separate model so that backends that
do not track token counts or tool calls can omit it without polluting the
result model.

---

## Current adoption status

The supported runtime now uses this contract layer directly:

- **Canonical proposal ownership** — ControlPlane owns `TaskProposal` and emits it
  from the supported planning path.
- **SwitchBoard contract usage** — SwitchBoard consumes `TaskProposal` at the
  `/route` boundary and returns canonical routing output (`LaneDecision`, and
  richer routing-plan artifacts where supported).
- **Canonical execution handoff** — the supported execute path builds a real
  `ExecutionRequest` from proposal + routing context and expects a canonical
  `ExecutionResult` back from the selected adapter.
- **Bounded adapters** — backend-specific code stays behind adapters such as
  kodo, Archon, and OpenClaw. Backend-native wire formats do not define the
  platform contract surface.
- **Policy / observability / tuning placement** — policy evaluates
  `TaskProposal + LaneDecision` before execution, observability retains the
  resulting canonical outcome, and tuning reads retained evidence to produce
  reviewable recommendations.

Historical phase language in earlier cleanup docs described this adoption as
future work. That is no longer true for the supported runtime.

## Compatibility-only residue

Some legacy compatibility types still exist, but they are not part of the
canonical cross-repo contract story:

- `control_plane.domain.BoardTask` remains a Plane-ingest compatibility model for
  the quarantined legacy execution path.
- `control_plane.legacy_execution` remains explicitly opt-in and disabled by
  default.
- A standalone `platform-contracts` distribution is optional packaging work, not
  a prerequisite for the current supported architecture.
